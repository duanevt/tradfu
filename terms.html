                        (&ldquo;<dfn>Account</dfn>&rdquo;). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18),

                        Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the
                        Services or Tradfu&rsquo;s termination of these Terms with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account,
                        and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by

                    <p>
                        The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account, and
                        you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive transportation or logistics services from Third Party Providers unless
                        they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to
                        comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes (e.g., no transport

                        property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party. In certain instances, you may be asked to provide proof
                        of identity to access or use the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of the Services if you refuse
                        to provide proof of identity.

                        operation of your use of the Services. You may opt-out of receiving text (SMS) messages from Tradfu at any time by sending an
                        email to support@Tradfu.com indicating that you no longer wish to receive such messages, along with the phone number of the mobile

                        establishes on a per promotional code basis (&ldquo;<dfn>Promo Codes</dfn>&rdquo;). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the
                        intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made
                        available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Tradfu; (iii) may be
                        disabled by Tradfu at any time for any reason without liability to Tradfu; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms
                        that Tradfu establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Tradfu reserves
                        the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any
                        other user in the event that Tradfu determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent,
                        illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.

                        (&ldquo;<dfn>Charges</dfn>&rdquo;). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Tradfu will facilitate
                        your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider&rsquo;s limited payment
                        collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third
                        Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable,
                        unless otherwise determined by Tradfu. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods
                        received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Tradfu will respond accordingly to any
                        request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.

                        All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Tradfu using the preferred payment method designated in your Account,
                        after which Tradfu will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or
                        otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Tradfu may, as the Third Party Provider&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent,
                        use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.

                        Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Tradfu will use reasonable
                        efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account
                        regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Tradfu may from time to time provide certain users with
                        promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained

                        or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider&rsquo;s arrival, in which case you may be
                        charged a cancellation fee.  Additionally, Third Party Providers can elect to cancel the provision of service at any time prior

                                If a cleaning service has been requested for Friday at 2pm (AEST), the customer must send written correspondence via instant message
                                to the service provider prior to Thursday 2pm (AEST), the day before. If it is cancelled within 24 hours, but outside 3 hours, customer
